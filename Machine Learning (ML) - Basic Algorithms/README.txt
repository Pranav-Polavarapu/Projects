- This folder is a compilation of 12 files(ipynb converted to PDF)
- It contains Python Codes related to various types of Machine Learning Algorithms, their results & Interpretations.
- Acts as a good starting point for anyone who's eager to learn about ML Algorithm at a beginner-to-Intermediate level.


Experiments:
1. Create a generic segregation of any business scenario data into training and testing
part with 70-30% proportions and analyze missing values. Further statistically
summarize the data also.
2. Explore and implement Linear regression algorithm in a given business scenario and
comment on its efficiency and performance.
3. Explore and implement logistic regression algorithm in a given business scenario and
comment on its efficiency and performance.
4. Explore and implement Linear Regression Using Gradient Descent in a given
business scenario and comment on its efficiency and performance.
5. Explore and implement Logistic Regression by Stochastic Gradient Descent in a
given business scenario and comment on its efficiency and performance.
6. Implement Decision Tree algorithm in a given business environment and comment on
its efficiency and performance.
7. Implement Naïve Bayes algorithm in a given business environment and comment on
its efficiency and performance.
8. Implement K Nearest Neighbors algorithm in a given business environment and
comment on its efficiency and performance.
9. Implement Support Vector Machine algorithm for classification in a given business
environment and comment on its efficiency and performance.
